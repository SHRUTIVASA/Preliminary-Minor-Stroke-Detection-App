# StrokeAlert: Preliminary Minor Stroke Detection App

A mobile application for the early, self-assistive detection of **minor strokes**, based on the clinically accepted **FAST criteria**. The app uses multimodal sensor inputs—camera, audio, and touch—to detect common early symptoms and prompt users to seek immediate medical attention if necessary.

## Publications

This app and its underlying research have been featured in the following international conferences:

* **StrokeAlert: Early Detection of Minor Strokes**, *2024 4th International Conference on Advancement in Electronics & Communication Engineering (AECE)*
* **A Comprehensive Review of Multimodal Techniques for Early Detection of Minor Strokes**, *2nd International Conference on Technologies for Energy, Agriculture, and Healthcare*

## Based on the FAST Criteria

The app is inspired by the medical **FAST** test used to detect stroke symptoms:

| FAST Component | App Feature                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F – Face**   | Facial asymmetry detection using the front camera                 |
| **A – Arms**   | Arm weakness simulated via tapping or movement test               |
| **S – Speech** | Voice analysis to detect slurred or delayed speech                |
| **T – Time**   | Urges users to act quickly and seek help if symptoms are detected |

## Features

* **Facial landmark analysis**: Uses on-device ML to detect signs of facial drooping
* **Touch test**: Checks coordination and speed using touchscreen tapping
* **Speech recognition**: Captures and evaluates clarity of user-spoken phrases
* **Risk evaluation**: Generates a stroke likelihood score based on combined tests
* **Immediate guidance**: Provides alerts and health advice based on FAST results
